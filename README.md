# Hardware-In-Loop Estimation and Control for Satellite Orbit Stabilization
A project involving hardware-in-the-loop simulation of a satellite orbiting earth. The nonlinear system dynamics and noisy measurements are simulated in Python, while control algorithms are computed in C on a PSOC microcontroller. The simulation environment interfaces with our microcontroller via UART serial communication.
